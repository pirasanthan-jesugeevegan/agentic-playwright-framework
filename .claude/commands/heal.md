Failing test: $ARGUMENTS

The healer must establish the root cause before changing anything, using the trace/Allure report
or a live MCP session, and classify the failure per `CLAUDE.md`'s flaky-test discipline. Hard
limits it may not cross:

- No weakening what the test asserts to make it green
- No `waitForTimeout`, no raising `retries`
- No updating a VR baseline without first confirming the visual change was intentional
- If the site is genuinely broken, mark `test.fixme()` with the defect named and report it
  rather than editing the test until it passes

It reports root cause, evidence, fix, and a clean verification run without retries.
