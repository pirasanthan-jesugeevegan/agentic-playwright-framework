Delegate to the **playwright-test-reviewer** agent. It is read-only: it reports, it does not fix.

File set to audit: $ARGUMENTS

If no file set is given, audit everything changed against `main`
(`git diff --name-only main...HEAD`).

The reviewer must work through its full checklist and additionally flag assertions that would
still pass if the site were broken. Findings come back as a table with file, line, severity, and
the fix. Blockers first. Clean files are named as clean.
